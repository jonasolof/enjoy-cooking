## About the Project

A recipe collection app build with React Native. At first targeting mainly iOS.

All the available recipe apps seem to be quite bloated with features. Thus, I thought I'd build my own.

### Design

Using Figma to design the layouts. If you feel like contributing, let me know. Here's a [view only link](https://www.figma.com/file/ChKizUcMZbFYXu5aVQXmJk/Enjoy-Cooking?node-id=0%3A1) to Figma.
